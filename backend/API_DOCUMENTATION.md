## üöÄ Development Notes

### Route Organization
- Routes are organized by functional areas
- Authentication middleware is applied to protected routes
- Resource routes follow RESTful conventions
- Custom routes are grouped logically

### Best Practices
- Always include proper error handling
- Use validation for all input data
- Return consistent response formats
- Include pagination for list endpoints
- Use proper HTTP status codes

### Future Enhancements
- Add rate limiting
- Implement API versioning
- Add comprehensive logging
- Enhance security measures
- Add bulk operations
- Implement webhooks
